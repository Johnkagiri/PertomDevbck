# ToDoLIST

# Project Concept:

The project aims to develop a web application for managing a simple todo list. Users can add, view, mark as completed, and delete todo items through a user-friendly interface. The application will utilize Node.js for the backend logic and MySQL for storing todo items.

# Approach:

1. Planning and Requirements Gathering:

- Define the features and functionalities required for the todo list application, including adding, viewing, marking as completed, and deleting todo items.
- Determine the technologies and tools to be used, such as Node.js for the backend and MySQL for the database.
  -Plan the database schema for storing todo items, including tables, columns
2. Database Design:

- Design the database schema for storing todo items. This includes creating a table for todo items with columns for task description, completion status, etc.
- Define appropriate data types, constraints, and relationships to ensure data integrity and efficiency.
- Implement the database schema using MySQL.

3. Backend Development (Node.js):

- Set up a Node.js project with the necessary dependencies, including Express.js for handling HTTP requests.
- Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing todo items in the MySQL database.
- Utilize proper error handling and asynchronous programming techniques to handle database interactions efficiently.
- Implement routes for adding, retrieving, marking as completed, and deleting todo items.

# Solution

1. Design the database schema for the todo items.
   CREATE TABLE todos (
   id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
   task VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   completed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false
   );

2. Set up a Node.js application with the necessary dependencies.
3. Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing todo items in the database.
4. Handle proper error handling and asynchronous programming techniques.
